## About this project

My goal with this Laravel tutorial to create a guide for those just learning Laravel. This guide will take you from the very beginning of an idea into a real deployable application.

This look at Laravel will not be exhaustive, but if you want a more exhaustive introduction I recommend the book Laravel: Up and Running. This tutorial does expect a few prerequisites and here is what you will need to follow along:

    A local PHP environment (Valet, Homestead, Vagrant, MAMP, etc.).
    A database (Iâ€™ll be using MySQL)
    PHPUnit installed.
    Node JS installed.

Note: For the local PHP development I Recommend Mac OSX and Valet because it automatically sets everything up. If you are on Windows, consider Homestead or some flavor of a virtual machine. Another option is a community-provided Windows port of Valet.

I am attempting to go through the process of creating a new application just as I would in a real-world environment. In fact, the code and idea are from a project I built.
